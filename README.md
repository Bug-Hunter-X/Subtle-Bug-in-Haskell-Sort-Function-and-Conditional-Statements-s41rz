# Subtle Bug in Haskell Sort Function and Conditional Statements

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the `sort` function in Haskell and how it interacts with conditional statements, particularly when dealing with comparing numbers or sorting lists.  The bug is not immediately obvious and highlights the importance of careful consideration of Haskell's behavior.

The `bug.hs` file contains the code exhibiting the issue.  The solution, and a discussion of the problem, can be found in `bugSolution.hs`.

This example is useful for understanding potential pitfalls when working with Haskell's list processing and conditional logic.
